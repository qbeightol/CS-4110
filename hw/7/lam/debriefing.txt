1. We spent roughly six hours on this assignment.
2. Overall, we thought the assignment was moderately difficult--getting some
   small details right was challenging, but otherwise we thought it was
   straightforward (and we definitely thought last friday's lecture helped).
3. Everyone participated.
4. We feel like we know roughly 70% well. To an extent, it felt like completing
   this assignment was a little mechanical--that we were mostly re-writing
   the CPS rules in OCaml--but we also understand the rules much better.
